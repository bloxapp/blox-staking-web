    title: 'Why are Blox Staking validators free of charge?',
    answer: `In order to give Eth 2.0 an early-stage power push, we decided to offer free service for all stakers.
            We will NOT charge you on any validators created during the “early stage” period.
            Once we start to charge our users, you will be notified (no surprise fees).
            Blox Staking service charges will only be applied to validators created after this promotion ends.
            Don't worry, we will NEVER charge you for creating or running the validators created during this promotion period.`,

  {
    title: 'Is it secure to deposit with Blox Staking?',
    answer: `First and foremost, Blox is completely non-custodial. We do not retain custody over ANY
             deposited funds; neither the ETH that is deposited in the Eth2 staking deposit contract,
             nor the service fee which is converted into CDT and then burnt. A deposit made through
             Blox is deposited directly to the Ethereum protocol, and never passes through our hands.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'How do I deposit using Ledger/Trezor?',
    answer: `MetaMask allows you to connect a Trezor or Ledger wallet to deposit ETH directly from your
             hardware wallet. For more information on how and why to connect Trezor and Ledger wallets,
             visit MetaMask's guide.`,

  {
    title: 'When will my validator be approved?',
    answer: `Validator approval times vary depending on network participation and the number of validators
             waiting in the queue. Normally, it can take between 4 to 24 hours. For your convenience,
             once your validator has been approved, we will notify you via email.
             You can also check the status of your validator on any Beacon Chain explorer.`,
